      <div class="tab-pane active" id="alaskan"><p> Alaskan Malamute: his arctic sled dog was bred for strength and endurance,
        and you don't want to get into a wrestling match with an Alaskan Malamute!
        They are incredibly strong, and you will need to commit to obedience training early
        so that you don't end up struggling to control a full-grown dog. They are independent
        and can be stubborn, so training can be a challenge.  </p></div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="eskimo"><p>Miniature American Eskimo Dog:
        The medium-length coat of the Miniature American Eskimo Dog only requires an occasional brushing.
        But because he sheds excessively you may find yourself brushing him daily to remove loose hair.</p></div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="beagle"><p>Beagle: The Beagle is merry, friendly, gentle, playful, and even-tempered.
        He has a sensitive nature. He can be distant with strangers until they've won him over. </p></div>
